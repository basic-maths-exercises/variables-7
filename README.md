# Good programming practise

Congratulations on completing the last exercise.  Now that you understand how to set and use variables you can write computer programs to solve most of the problems that will come up in your maths course.  Furthermore, there is only one additional thing (logic) that you need to need to learn about. You will then be able to write programs that solve __all__ the maths problems you might encounter.  Logic will be introduced in another one of these repl courses.  In the rest of this particular set of exercises, we are going to learn how to apply the first rule of good programming.  This first rule states:

__The more code you write the more mistakes you will make.__ 

In response to this realisation, the people who develop programming languages have introduced a lot of programming commands that allow you to shorten the codes you write.  Learning these commands does not allow you to write programs that complete more mathematical tasks.  To be clear, __you can already write programs that complete all the tasks that will be introduced in the next few exercises__.    Using these new commands will, however, allow you to solve these problems using less code.

To see how these commands work we are going to rewrite the code in `main.py`.  This code evaluates and prints the first 11 terms in the seven times table.^  The code is 23 lines long and 12 different variables are used within it.  By the time you complete all the exercise in section 2, we will have reduced this to four lines of python and we will have only three variables.

For this first exercise, however, I  just want to check that you understand how the code works.  So, with that in mind:

__Modify the code in main.py so that it outputs the first 11 numbers in the 13 times table.__

^ *0 times 7 is maybe not the first number in the seven times table that you learned at school.  Trust me when I tell you that this is there for an important reason, which we will come to in due course.*
